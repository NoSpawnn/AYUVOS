# As Yet Unnamed Void-based Operating System

- Opinionated, batteries-included, desktop Void Linux based distribution
- Built using [void-linux/void-mklive](https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive)
- Currently, builds **MUST** be done on an existing Void installation
    - I do plan on trying to get containerised builds working, but that's not a priority, just use a VM if you need to
